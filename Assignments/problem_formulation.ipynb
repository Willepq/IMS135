    "a) Implement your FEM or finite difference solver to get a high resolution solver. Assume heat source distribution like the moving \"tent_distribution\" in the codes for the bar problem. Assume a width of the tent $L/10$ and that it moves from left to right with a velocity $L/t_{end}$ where $L=1000$ mm and $t_{end}=1000$ s. Assume the maximum value of $E_x/k$ to be 1000 K/m$^2$. Try some different time and spatial distributions such that the results becomes \"accurate enough\". \n",

    "b) Based on the data from the high resolution solver in a) perform SVD analysis. In particular, give the singular values and illustrate some of the spatial modes $\\mathbf{\\Phi}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "d) Now you change the heat source to a moving Hertzian type of distribution (with the same width and maximum value as in the tent distribution). Compare the results from your high resolution solver to results from reduced order modelling. Note that you should not change the modes from b) (that are from the tent distribution loading). Compare the number of unknowns you have in reduced order modelling with your high resolution model. "
